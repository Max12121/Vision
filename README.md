# Vision
Vision is the most powerful tool detecting technologies and
services used on websites like web frameworks, web services,
server software, libraries, widgets, content management systems, social platforms,
e-commerce platforms, analytics software,
developer tools and more.

Through Vision you can:
-   **Detect any technology or service used in a website**.
-   **Define technologies and services easily without
advanced technical knowledge**, for instance you can detect
a JavaScript library by just adding its file name.
-   **Have maximum flexibility for defining the way technologies and
services are detected**: from a wide range of intuitive
predefined patterns to custom JavaScript code.
-   **Have atomic definitions**, for instance "Facebook Like Button"
and "Facebook Share Button" are clearly distinguished and not superficially
defined as just "Facebook".
