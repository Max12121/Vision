# Vision
Vision is the most powerful tool detecting technologies and
services used on websites like web frameworks, web services,
server software, content management systems, forum platforms,
e-commerce platforms, APIs, libraries, widgets, analytics software,
developer tools and more.

## Why Vision?
Vision is here to fill the lack of reliability of its alternatives
which are changing API too frequently and difficult to handle
and enrich.

Through Vision you can:
-   **Define technologies and services easily without
advanced technical knowledge**, for instance you can detect
a library by just adding its JavaScript file name.
-   **Have maximum flexibility for defining technologies and
services through intuitive predefined patterns** or through custom
JavaScript code, you can also directly use CSS selectors!
-   **Match anything thanks to options like headless browser
detection bypass or lazy load bypass**.
-   **Have atomic definitions**, for
instance "Facebook Like Button" and "Facebook
Share Button" are clearly distinguished and not defined
as just "Facebook".
