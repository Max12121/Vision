# Vision
Vision is the most powerful tool detecting technologies and
services used on websites like web frameworks, web services,
server software, content management systems, forum platforms,
e-commerce platforms, APIs, libraries, widgets, analytics software,
developer tools and more.

## Why Vision?
Vision is here to fill the lack of reliability of its alternatives
which are changing API too frequently, not handling exceptions,
difficult to enrich.

Through Vision you can:
-   Define technologies and services easily without
advanced technical knowledge, for instance you can detect
a library by just adding its JavaScript file name.
-   Have double the information about technologies and services
than alternative softwares.
-   Have maximum flexibility for defining technologies and
services through intuitive predefined patterns or through your
custom pattern, for instance you can detect a service also by
writing your custom JavaScript code.
