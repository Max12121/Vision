# Vision
Vision is the most powerful tool detecting technologies and
services used on websites like web frameworks, web services,
server software, libraries, widgets, content management systems, social platforms,
e-commerce platforms, analytics software and more.

Through Vision you can:
-   **Reliably detect technologies and services used in websites**
thanks to a list of patterns constantly updated and maintained.
-   **Define new technologies and services easily without
advanced technical knowledge**, for instance you can detect
a JavaScript library by just adding its file name.
-   **Have maximum flexibility for defining how technologies and
services are detected**: from a wide range of intuitive
predefined patterns to custom JavaScript code.
-   **Have atomic definitions**, for instance `Facebook Like Button`
and `Facebook Share Button` are clearly distinguished and not superficially
defined as just `Facebook`.

## Entries
All technologies and services that can
be identified by Vision are defined as entries.
